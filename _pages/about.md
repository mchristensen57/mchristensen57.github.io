Hello! I'm Matt, currently a Chief Medical Resident and clinical researcher at the [University of Utah](https://medicine.utah.edu/internalmedicine/residency/). I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago and I've been exploring the 4 continental US time zones ~q4years via I-80. I'm interested generally in the application of engineering principals to medicine, which currently means trying to understand the best regimen to treat pneumonia and learning to build clinical decision support tools. My current advisors are [Barb Jones](https://healthcare.utah.edu/fad/mddetail.php?physicianID=u0102859&name=barbara-e-jones) and [Matt Samore](https://healthcare.utah.edu/fad/mddetail.php?physicianID=u0102331&name=matthew-h-samore). In the past I've been fortunate to work with [Greg Marcus](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/gregory.marcus), [Tom Sisson](https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/1078/thomas-harold-sisson-md), [David Burke](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/human-genetics/david-burke-phd), and [Jonathan Butcher](http://www.butcherlab.com). 


While I don't consider myself a "full stack programmer", I like building and this site is my first foray into Github and markdown. Managed with Atom.

My aim is to eventually add in resources for clinical education, research, and clinical/research workflow.
