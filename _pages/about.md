Hello! I'm Matt, an internal medicine resident and researcher currently at the [University of Utah](https://medicine.utah.edu/internalmedicine/residency/). I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago and I've been exploring the 4 continental US time zones ~q4years via I-80. I'm interested generally in the application of engineering principals to medicine, which currently means trying to understand the best regimen to treat pneumonia and learning to build clinical decision support tools. My current advisors are [Barb Jones](https://healthcare.utah.edu/fad/mddetail.php?physicianID=u0102859&name=barbara-e-jones) and [Matt Samore](https://healthcare.utah.edu/fad/mddetail.php?physicianID=u0102331&name=matthew-h-samore). In the past I've been fortunate to work with [Greg Marcus](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/gregory.marcus), [Tom Sisson](https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/1078/thomas-harold-sisson-md), [David Burke](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/human-genetics/david-burke-phd), and [Jonathan Butcher](http://www.butcherlab.com). 


While I don't think I qualify as a "programmer", this site is another stab at some tinkering and my first foray into Github and markdown. Managed with Atom.

My aim is to eventually add in resources for clinical education, research, and clinical/research workflow.
