Hello! I'm Matt, an internal medicine resident and researcher currently at the [University of Utah](https://medicine.utah.edu/internalmedicine/residency/). I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago and I've been exploring the 4 continental US time zones ~q4years via I-80. I'm interested generally in the application of engineering principals to medicine, which currently means trying to understanding and support clinical decisions in treating pneumonia. 


While I don't think I qualify as a "programmer", this site is another stab at some tinkering and my first foray into Github with inspiration from [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io) courtesy of [Stuart Geiger](http://stuartgeiger.com). 

My aim is to build this out to be my virtual landing page, and to eventually add in resources for clinical education, research, and workflow.
